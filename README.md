### 💼 Business Problem
The company is experiencing high sales volume but seeing disproportionately low profits in certain categories. Management needed a clear visualization to understand:
1. Which products are driving losses?
2. How are sales trending year-over-year?
3. Which regions and customer segments are most profitable?

### 🔍 Key Insights & Findings
* **Profitability Leaks:** While "Tables" generate significant revenue, they are the primary source of financial loss (shown in deep red on the dashboard), suggesting a need to re-evaluate pricing or shipping costs for this category.
* **Top Performers:** "Copiers" and "Phones" are the most profitable sub-categories.
* **Sales Trends:** Sales have been consistently increasing from 2014 to 2017, but profit margins have not followed the same trajectory.
* **Regional Analysis:** The Dashboard allows filtering by State to pinpoint specific low-performing geographic areas.

### 🛠️ Technical Skills Used
* **Data Cleaning:** Used Power Query to correct data types (resolving currency formatting issues) and remove null values.
* **Data Modeling:** Established relationships between Sales and Location tables.
* **DAX Measures:** Created calculated measures for Total Sales, Total Profit, and Profit Margin.
* **Data Visualization:**
    * Used **Conditional Formatting** to highlight negative values (Red for loss, Blue for profit).
    * Implemented interactive **Slicers** for dynamic filtering by Year and State.
    * Designed a clean, user-friendly layout focusing on actionable KPIs.
